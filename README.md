🎨 How to Use the Gradient Generator
This tool allows you to create high-resolution mesh gradients for wallpapers, UI backgrounds, or digital art.

1. Set Your Dimensions
Manual Input: Enter the width and height in pixels (e.g., 1920 x 1080).

Presets: Use the Presets dropdown to quickly select common sizes like 1080p, 4K, or your current Monitor resolution.

2. Choose a Color Theme
Select a Theme Mode to control how colors are generated:

Custom Colors: Manually pick two specific colors.

Monochromatic: Generates variations of a single base hue.

Complementary/Triadic/Square: Uses color theory math to find colors that look great together.

The Rainbow Slider: When not in "Custom" mode, use this slider to shift the base hue across the entire color spectrum.

3. Fine-Tune the Visuals
Blob Size & Amount: Adjust how many "blobs" appear and how large they are. Larger blobs create smoother, more ethereal blends.

Brightness & Saturation: Control the "vibe"—lower saturation creates a moody, pastel look, while high brightness makes colors "pop".

Noise (Grain): Adds a film-grain texture to the preview to prevent color banding and add a tactile feel.

4. Saving and Sharing
The Seed System: Every unique gradient has a Seed (a short string of text).

If you love a specific result, Copy the seed.

To recreate it later, just paste that seed back into the input box.
